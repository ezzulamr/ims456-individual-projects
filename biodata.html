        <H1 align="justify">My name is <spans>Izzul Amir</spans>. Born on <spans>February 24th, 2002 </spans> , <spans> 21 </spans> years old. My faith is <spans> Islam </spans>, and I am a <spans>Malaysian </spans> citizen. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favourite courses are <spansd>Intermediate Economic</spansd>  and <spansd>International Economy </spansd> . My goal is to score in these subjects and become a respected professional in one of the fields. I can say that I am a <spans>responsible</spans> and a <spans> hard-working </spans> student. The goal I’m currently striving for is to <spansd> make this world a better place to live</spansd> in by starting the changes with myself . Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: <spans>enthusiastic </spans>, <spans>communicative </spans>and <spans> passionate </spans>because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that  I’m on the right path and I will do my best <spansd>to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well </spansd>.  </H1>
